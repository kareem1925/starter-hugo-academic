<div style="text-align: justify">
Kareem is a quantum machine learning researcher with a unique interdisciplinary scientific background. He has a B.Sc in Communications & Electronics Engineering alongside an interesting record of online courses in machine learning, physics, and programming. He has around 4 years of experience in Computer and Machine Vision systems at <a href="https://devisionx.com/" target="_blank">DevisionX</a> and two years of experience in being a machine learning instructor.
<br/><br/>
Alongside his machine learning career, he taught himself about quantum computing and managed to become a researcher at the Alexandria Quantum Computing group. Then he became a Qiskit Advocate. After that, he earned a position as a research assistant at <a href="https://wigner.hu/" target="_blank">Wigner Research Centre for Physics</a> to focus on Photonic Quantum Computation.
<br/><br/>
Currently, he is doing two master's degrees: an MSc in <a href="https://quantum-explore.com/en/master/" target="_blank">Quantum Computing Technologies at Universidad Politécnica de Madrid</a> that will finish later in 2022, and the other one is in Computer Engineering at Suez Canal University that is expected to be finished in 2023.

<div style="text-align: justify">
In short, I love <b><i>Physics</i></b> and I'm aspiring to be a theoretical physicist one day!
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: justify">
Right now, I'm involved in developing a quantum photonic simulator called <a href="https://piquasso.com/" target="_blank">Piquasso</a>, I'm mostly interested in quantum feature maps and their profound implications on quantum varitional circuits, and I'm open to collaborate. Moreover, I'm looking to further my industrial experience in computer vision.
