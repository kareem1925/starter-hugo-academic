abstract: Due to the pivotal role of UV photodiodes in many technological applications
  in tandem with the high efficiency achieved by machine learning techniques in regression
  and classification problems, different artificial intelligence techniques are adopted
  to simulate and model the performance of organic/inorganic heterojunction UV photodiode.
  Herein, the performance of a fabricated Au/NTCDA/p-Si/Al photodiode is explained
  in a detailed manner and has shown an excellent responsivity and detectivity for
  UV light of intensities ranging from 20 to 80mW/cm2. A linear currentâ€“irradiance
  relationship is exhibited by the fabricated photodiode under illumination up to
  65mW/cm2. It also shows good response times of trise=408ms and tfall=490ms. Furthermore,
  we have not only fitted the characteristic I-V curve but also evaluated three classical
  algorithms; K-Nearest Neighbour, Artificial Neural Network, and Genetic Programming
  besides using a Quantum Neural Network to predict the behavior of the device. The
  models have achieved outstanding results and managed to capture the trend of the
  target values. The Quantum Neural Network has been used for the first time to model
  the photodiode characteristics. The trained models are of great significance since
  they can be used to reduce the characterization and measurement times.
